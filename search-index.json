They think being 'full stack' makes them better. It does, but only for a short time. As a company grows, functions get specialized. Without a clear specialty, your talent for being able to put together all the pieces has a tendency to get overlooked by your boss. Especially when you get a new boss. They'll tell you that you don't have enough yea...",

Every time I show up at a new gym, I get picked last, end up on a terrible team, or have to wait a few games.
